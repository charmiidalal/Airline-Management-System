Travel Agency Management System
-------------------------------

Travel agency has, 
1. customer directory 
2. master schedule
3. Airliners

* For each airliner, there is fleet of airplanes
* For each airplane define its attributes and that include the number of seats (Seats and Seat Assignments will be accounted for on Flight for this homework assignment.) 
* For each flight create associated seats. Seats come into 2 columns and each row is made up of six seats (window, middle, and Aisle). Assume each airplane will have 25 rows. 
* For the customer directory create customers where some are assigned seats on flights. 
* Users have an option to navigate to a Panel which allows multi-field/multi-parameter search of flights.
